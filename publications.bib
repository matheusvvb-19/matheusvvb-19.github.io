 abstract = {Over the years, several neural network architectures have been proposed to process and represent texts using dense vectors (known as word embeddings): mathematical representations that encode the meaning of words or phrases. Word embeddings can be computed by many different algorithms, usually trained on large amounts of textual data aiming to capture semantic relationships between words. These embeddings revolutionized many Natural Language Processing applications, enabling more accurate and nuanced language understanding. Recently, it was demonstrated that it is possible to employ word embeddings to uncover latent knowledge, i.e., information that may be implicit in a set of texts and that would hardly be perceptible to humans. In this context, this study extends such strategy by combining different unsupervised models to accelerate discoveries in medicine. Our word embeddings were trained on a large corpus of medical papers related to Acute Myeloid Leukemia, a highly malignant form of cancer. Our study shows that established therapies could have been developed before their first proposal due to treatment testing notifications issued by our system up to 11 years in advance. The results show the potential of uncovering latent knowledge from the biomedical field to empower faster and more efficient drug testing for medical discoveries.},

abstract = {Traffic incidents involving vulnerable road users (VRUs) constitute a significant proportion of global road accidents. Advances in traffic communication ecosystems, coupled with sophisticated signal processing and machine learning techniques, have facilitated the utilization of data from diverse sensors. Despite these advancements and the availability of extensive datasets, substantial progress is required to mitigate traffic casualties. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of state-of-the-art technologies and methodologies to enhance the safety of VRUs. The study investigates the communication networks between vehicles and VRUs, emphasizing the integration of advanced sensors and the availability of relevant datasets. It explores preprocessing techniques and data fusion methods to enhance sensor data quality. Furthermore, our study assesses critical simulation environments essential for developing and testing VRU safety systems. Our research also highlights recent advances in VRU detection and classification algorithms, addressing challenges such as variable environmental conditions. Additionally, we cover cutting-edge research in predicting VRU intentions and behaviors, which is mandatory for proactive collision avoidance strategies. Through this survey, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the current landscape of VRU safety technologies, identifying areas of progress and areas needing further research and development.}
