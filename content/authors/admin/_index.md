Recieved my BSc degree in Computer Science from [Federal University of S達o Carlos](https://www.sorocaba.ufscar.br/) (UFSCar), Sorocaba campus. During my undergraduate studies, I conducted two funded research projects in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), including a period of international research internship. Currently, I am a MSc student of the [Postgraduate Program in Computer Science](https://www.ppgcc.ufscar.br/pt-br) (PPGCC) at UFSCar and a member of the [Intelligent Systems and Data Science Laboratory](https://lasid.dcomp.ufscar.br/) (LaSID). My MSc research focuses on AI and ML for intelligent traffic safety in smart cities.
