I received my Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree in Computer Science from the [Federal University of S達o Carlos](http://www.ufscar.br/) (UFSCar), Sorocaba campus, in 2024. During my undergraduate studies, I conducted two funded research projects in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), including an international research internship. I am currently a Master's (MSc) student in the [Graduate Program in Computer Science](https://www.ppgcc.ufscar.br/pt-br) (PPGCC) at UFSCar and a member of the [Intelligent Systems and Data Science Laboratory](https://lasid.dcomp.ufscar.br/) (LaSID). My MSc research focuses on applying AI and ML to intelligent traffic safety in smart cities.
