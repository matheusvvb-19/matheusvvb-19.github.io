abstract: 'Over the years, several neural network architectures have been proposed
  to process and represent texts using dense vectors (known as word embeddings): mathematical
  representations that encode the meaning of words or phrases. Word embeddings can
  be computed by many different algorithms, usually trained on large amounts of textual
  data aiming to capture semantic relationships between words. These embeddings revolutionized
  many Natural Language Processing applications, enabling more accurate and nuanced
  language understanding. Recently, it was demonstrated that it is possible to employ
  word embeddings to uncover latent knowledge, i.e., information that may be implicit
  in a set of texts and that would hardly be perceptible to humans. In this context,
  this study extends such strategy by combining different unsupervised models to accelerate
  discoveries in medicine. Our word embeddings were trained on a large corpus of medical
  papers related to Acute Myeloid Leukemia, a highly malignant form of cancer. Our
  study shows that established therapies could have been developed before their first
  proposal due to treatment testing notifications issued by our system up to 11 years
  in advance. The results show the potential of uncovering latent knowledge from the
  biomedical field to empower faster and more efficient drug testing for medical discoveries.'
