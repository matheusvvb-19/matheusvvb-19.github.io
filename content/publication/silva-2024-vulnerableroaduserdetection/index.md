abstract: Traffic incidents involving vulnerable road users (VRUs) constitute a significant
  proportion of global road accidents. Advances in traffic communication ecosystems,
  coupled with sophisticated signal processing and machine learning techniques, have
  facilitated the utilization of data from diverse sensors. Despite these advancements
  and the availability of extensive datasets, substantial progress is required to
  mitigate traffic casualties. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of state-of-the-art
  technologies and methodologies to enhance the safety of VRUs. The study delves into
  the communication networks between vehicles and VRUs, emphasizing the integration
  of advanced sensors and the availability of relevant datasets. It explores preprocessing
  techniques and data fusion methods to enhance sensor data quality. Furthermore,
  our study assesses critical simulation environments essential for developing and
  testing VRU safety systems. Our research also highlights recent advances in VRU
  detection and classification algorithms, addressing challenges such as variable
  environmental conditions. Additionally, we cover cutting-edge research in predicting
  VRU intentions and behaviors, which is crucial for proactive collision avoidance
  strategies. Through this survey, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding
  of the current landscape of VRU safety technologies, identifying areas of progress
  and areas needing further research and development.
